- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarieAmbusk
- 👀 I’m interested in finding repositories of data training sets of TREE ROOTS collected by Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) devices.
- 🌱 I’m currently the PI of a research project looking to assess the quality of TREE ROOTS using GPR technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and build upon elements of existing data sets available to distingush roots from other elements present in soil/substrate, outlining and measuring them to produce a matrix of root system to then assess the quality aspect.
